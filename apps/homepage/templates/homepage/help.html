  <h2>{% blocktrans %}What is Kallisto?{% endblocktrans %}</h2>
  <p>{% blocktrans with spacelog_url='http://spacelog.org' %}
    Kallisto is a collaborative tool for cleaning up transcripts of space
    missions so that they can be used on
    <a href='{{ spacelog_url }}'>Spacelog</a>.
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h2>{% blocktrans %}How do I use it?{% endblocktrans %}</h2>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}
    When you clean up a transcript page on Kallisto, you see an image of the
    original on the left, and the text on the right. The idea is to make the
    text match the original, by fixing any differences you see.
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}
    Each page will be shown to at least two people. If you don't see any
    problems, save the page without making changes to confirm that it's
    correct. Kallisto will mark that page as finished, and not show it to
    anyone else.
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}
    The majority of the content on each page will be lines spoken by the
    astronauts or ground control staff. A typical line looks like this:
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <pre>02 07 55 20  CMP  I believe we've had a problem here.</pre>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}The line has three components:{% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <ol>
    <li>{% blocktrans %}
      <code>02 07 55 20</code> is the time that this line was recorded.
      In this case, it was 2 days, 7 hours, 55 minutes, and 20 seconds into
      the mission. Shorter missions might not include the number of days.
    {% endblocktrans %}</li>
    <li>{% blocktrans %}
      <code>CMP</code> is the person speaking. In this case, CMP is short for
      Command Module Pilot.
    {% endblocktrans %}</li>
    <li>{% blocktrans %}
      <code>I believe we've had a problem here</code> is what was said. It might
      span several lines.
    {% endblocktrans %}</li>
  </ol>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}
    If possible, it's helpful to leave "- -" at the end of the line as is,
    rather than "correct" it to a single dash, or "--" or something. The
    Spacelog Web site will display this nicely, and we prefer not to change the
    intent of the original transcripts where possible.
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}
    The other lines—lines where no one is speaking—are important too. They
    contain extra information, like telling us when the spacecraft starts a new
    orbit or starts communicating with a different ground station.
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <h2>{% blocktrans %}What's the mission wiki page for?{% endblocktrans %}</h2>

  <p>{% blocktrans with apollo8_wiki_url='https://github.com/Spacelog/Spacelog/wiki/Mission:-Apollo-8' %}
    At the top of each page is a link to a mission wiki page, for example
    here's the
    <a href='{{ apollo8_wiki_url }}'>mission wiki page for Apollo 8</a>.
    Editing the wiki page requires a GitHub account, but it's free to
    sign up.
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}
    The wiki page is a useful place to keep notes about things that you notice
    while transcribing the mission, that might be useful for adding the extra
    information we'll want to display on the Spacelog Web site.
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <p>{% blocktrans %}
    The following kinds of information are usually very useful:
  {% endblocktrans %}</p>

  <ul>
    <li>{% blocktrans %}
      Any time a ground crew member is called by name. The ground staff often
      operated in shifts, so the same speaker identifier in the
      transcript—<code>CC</code> for the capsule communicator, <code>F</code>
      for the flight director, etc.—can refer to different people at different
      times during the mission.
    {% endblocktrans %}</li>
    <li>{% blocktrans %}
      Log lines that stand out as particularly interesting or amusing. These
      make good quotations to highlight on the mission's home page.
    {% endblocktrans %}</li>
    <li>{% blocktrans %}
      Significant mission events. These might mark the end of one phase of a
      mission and the beginning of the next, like when a spacecraft leaves
      Earth orbit for the Moon, or they might be a significant moment, like a
      live TV broadcast or the moment when Apollo 13 sent the famous message
      “Houston, we've had a problem”.
    {% endblocktrans %}</li>
    <li>{% blocktrans %}
      Moments that might correspond to photographs we can add to the mission
      transcript. The crew might, for example, directly report that they've
      just taken a photo of something specific.
    {% endblocktrans %}</li>
    <li>{% blocktrans %}
      Terms that should appear in the mission glossary. Space flight is full
      of technical terms, and if you encounter an unfamiliar term it's good to
      make a note of it. If you happen to look up the definition, then it's
      good to make a note of that, too.
    {% endblocktrans %}</li>
    <li>{% blocktrans %}
      Lines or pages that might cause trouble. The original transcripts
      sometimes contain strange characters, missing times, footnotes, and other
      unusual features that might need extra attention when we import the
      mission into the Spacelog Web site.
    {% endblocktrans %}</li>
  </ul>

  <p>{% blocktrans with trello_url='https://trello.com/b/g3qm266Q/missions' %}
    Once we've cleaned every page in the mission, there's still a lot of work
    to do before it can be launched on Spacelog. You can keep track of where
    each mission is up to on our
    <a href='{{ trello_url }}'>missions Trello board</a>.
